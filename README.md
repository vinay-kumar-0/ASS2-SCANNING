# ASS2-SCANNING
This is the 2nd assignment I have done in my internship journey. This is about scanning phase, which is the 2nd phase of Ethical Hacking.


In this assignment I have learnt about the tools such as nmap, nslookup and whois domain tools.
I have learnt how powerfull the nmap and it's scirpts are? 
nmap here in the assignment is used for scanning and enumerating.
whois domains tools to find the detailed information about the target website.
reverseIp lookup which converts IP's to domain names.
